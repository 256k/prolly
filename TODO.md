# todos & ideas:

- crow/jf output integration
- change the note of each sequencer
- change the octave for each sequencer
- convert the clock.run function into a lattice 
- change the clock division for each sequencer
- add rotation to the probability array
- arc integration
- grid integration
- change UI to have a more visual representation of the sequence, it's playhead and the probability of each step represented in opacity/brightness 
- have a global page that shows all the sequences together on horizontal lines with playheads and probability
- add ability for each track to step through multiple notes on each consecutive loop
